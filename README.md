** Special session description  ** 
In this session, we aim to collect original research and review papers on the application of computational intelligence technologies in Human Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Human-Machine Collaboration. Recent research in rehabilitation and Human Enhancement has led to new approaches which have led to more positive Human-Machine Collaboration effects. Technologies have also played a pivotal role in transforming rehabilitation towards quantitative and personalised treatments. Human-factored design and human-machine interactions are essential considerations in systems. However, using the Human-Machine Collaboration system to exploit effective motor assistance while preserving natural, intuitive, smooth, and harmonious motion is still a significant challenge in the design and control of the system. Moreover, biomechatronic and user-centred design and control solutions are continuously evolving to improve wearability and ergonomics, functionality and effectiveness, as well as acceptability and usability. Novel assessment methods and protocols are currently being developed to analyse Human–Machine interaction from robotic, biomechanical, and physiological perspectives.

With the increasing complexity of human working and living environment, the scale of data generated and the influencing factors are increasing. This can lead to more uncertainty in the control process and eventually lead to unexpected situations in human-machine collaboration or rehabilitation or affect human augmentation. In this case, new approaches are needed to address new challenges to enable the system to achieve superior performance in more complex environments. Artificial intelligence technology represented by deep learning can find more hidden knowledge and associations in feature extraction and has good data adaptability in adaptation control. In recent years, AI-based human intention recognition, analysis, prediction and control has gradually become a research hotspot and widely used in human rehabilitation, enhancement and human-machine collaboration.

This issue aims to collect original research and review articles on computational intelligence technologies in Human Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Human-Machine Collaboration.
